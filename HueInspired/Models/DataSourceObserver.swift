// I feel the pending state is too transient to be modeled as a part 
// of DataSourceState

// It was the reason for the whole Dispatch Queue, so we can make sure 
// the state transitions correctly to the consquence of previous call
// otherwise errors maybe missed
// e.g if we're waiting on a promise, a sync call to syncData would
// transition to fuliflled and then we wouldn't get a pending state

// The main goal was to have data source object properlly show
// pending state
